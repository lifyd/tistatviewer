## **Why:**
<p align="right">
Valve's web-based client (http://www.dota2.com/watch/) for watching Dota 2 games in the browser _is_ available. The problem is however, the client tends to be quite buggy, doesn't have Twitch chat, and the stats (Top left pane, and the map.) sometimes randomly malfunctions. 

The goal of this small web project was to use some old web technologies (Iframe> and table) and create something incredibly basic for this purpose. 

The original goal was to use Valve's web-based client (as it has stats baked in.) and merge that with Twitch Chat. Unfortunately, the web-based client will not appear in an Iframe. Therefore, the Twitch browser-based viewer was combined with a third-party web-based stats site.
